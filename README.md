# iNaturalist dashboard

A dashboard created by leveraging the iNaturalist API to extract my own information and visualize it. First, it requests the data through the [iNaturalist API](https://api.inaturalist.org/v1/docs/).

### Next steps:
- Take the species name and join it to the AphiaID. 
- Create database with taxonomic breakdown
- Create visualizations in a streamlit app
